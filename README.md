*Webclone Tool*

Welcome to the Webclone tool, my  first Termux project! This tool allows you to easily download the source code of a website directly from your Android device using Termux. Below are the steps to set up and use the Webclone tool effectively.

##please fork and star, this is my first Termux project

*Setting up the Environment*
1. *Install Termux*: If you haven't already, download and install Termux from the Google Play Store or F-Droid.

2. *Install Node.js*: In Termux, run the following command to install Node.js:
   ```
   pkg install nodejs
   ```

3. *Clone the Webclone Repository*: Clone the `webclone` repository by running:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/Cod3Uchiha/webclone.git
   ```

4. *Navigate to the Project Directory*: Change to the project directory by running:
   ```
   cd webclone
   ```

5. *Install Dependencies*: Install the required `axios` library by running:
   ```
   npm install axios
   ```

*Running the Tool*
To run the Webclone tool, execute the following command in the Termux terminal:
   ```
   node webclone.js
   ```

You will then be prompted to enter the URL of the website you want to download. After providing the URL and pressing Enter, the tool will download the website source code and save it to a file with a name based on the website URL.
